    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <h5>This website is the portfolio for the <i>Scripting Programming Language Fundamentals</i> course I'm taking for fall 2024.</h5>
    <div class="welcomeIMG" style="height:200px;"></div>
    <p>Using some simple HTML and CSS, this portfolio came to life. As the course progresses, hopefully this site will be updated and improved regularly to reflect my new skills and my own stylistic features!</p>

  <div class="main" id="about">
    <h2>A bit about me:</h2>
    <h5>On the surface, I'm a second year software engineering student from Western.</h5>
    <p>However, even though I enjoy coding, I also really like UI/UX design. Rather than being fullstack or back-end, I'd rather stick to the frontend :)</p>
    <p>I also like business. During high school, I took almost all of the business courses that were offered, and after BUS 1299 last year, I'm taking BUS 2257 this year! I'm hoping to become either a <b>product manager</b> or <b>tech consultant</b> as a profession, as I feel like it is a very creative and fast-paced environment, which I feel that I would thrive in!</p>
    <p>Outside of academics, I like watching law and crime content, especially <i>Law and Order, Suits</i>, and true crime videos. I cook a lot, and bake when I have time. I love food, and dream about travelling the world to experience different cuisines :D</p>
  </div>

  <div class="main" id="work_exp">
    <h2>An overview of my professional experience:</h2>
    <h5>I completed my first co-op term this summer!</h5>
    <p>I worked at a small water quality company that produces their own hardware, and is now producing their own software to go with it!</p>
    <p>Since it was a smaller scaled company, I was able to directly touch their codebase, which was pretty big and daunting. However, since most of it was already functioning and 90% completed, I wasn't in any real risk of messing anything up.</p>
    <p>Other than that, I don't have much professional coding experience. I have some research experience though, helping at various labs and research groups, including ones in psychology and also robotics. My first real job was at a local bubble tea store from my hometown, where I'm still very close and in contact with my old boss, and tons of my old co-workers! I really developed some customer service and communication skills there, and it made me realize why everyone recommends to work in either retail or the service industry at least once in their lives.</p>
    <p>Either way, I'm super excited to see what's next in my journey :)</p>
